# EXAMPLE: CONDUITS DEFINITIONS:
# Here is where the rubber hits the road and where we define actual "conduits"
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
contexts:

  # Each set of conduits is scoped within a "context" which is simply
  # a sub-scope within a "environment". It is just an arbitrary name
  # that you can set to whatever you'd like
  # @see: https://github.com/bitsofinfo/appdeploy#convention
  stage-qa:

    # ---------------------
    # SERVICES
    # Here we define one or more named "services"
    # Each "service" has a "name" and a set of k8s selectors
    # which define what pods the service will target
    #-----------------------
    services:

      # service "name"
      dog1:
        # the service's selectors, can be any valid k8s label selectors
        tls: false # default is TRUE if omitted
        selector:
          app-name: "dogapp"
          app-version: "1.0.0"
      dog2:
        tls: false # default is TRUE if omitted
        selector:
          app-name: "dogapp"
          app-version: "2.0.0"
      cat1:
        tls: false
        selector:
          app-name: "catapp"
          app-version: "1.0.0"
      cat2:

          app-version: "2.0.0"

    # ---------------------
    # INGRESSs
    # Here we define one or more named "Ingress"
    # Each "ingress" has a "name" and a set of one
    # or more "mappings" which configure host/paths
    # that will configured on the generated Ingress'
    # as well as the 'serviceBindings' for the Ingress
    # that point back to the named services defined above
